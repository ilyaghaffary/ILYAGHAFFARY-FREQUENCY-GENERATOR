* **〰️ Dynamic Wavy Animations (NEW):** Frames and buttons now feature a continuous **wavy (up and down) motion**, like a heartbeat or a subtle sound wave, ensuring a captivating, yet non-interfering, layout.
* **🧠 Audio Generation Modes:** Supports all primary brainwave and therapeutic wave generation modes, including Binaural Beats, Isochronic Tones, Solfeggio Frequencies, and Noise Therapy.
* **🌐 Multi-Language Support:** Full support for both **English 🇬🇧** and **Persian 🇮🇷** languages.
* **🔬 Scientific Presets:** Includes famous brainwave frequencies (Gamma, Theta, Delta) and Solfeggio frequencies (e.g., 432, 528 Hz).

* **User Interface (UI):** Built using a **modern cross-platform framework**, focusing on **fast rendering** and **fluid, custom animations**.
* **Animations:** Achieved using **low-level graphics rendering** and **precise mathematical functions** to create the **pulsing** neon glow effects and the **wavy** movement of all main widgets.
* **Audio Engine:** Developed using **high-performance libraries** for accurate, real-time generation of pure sine waves and various noise types directly to the user's audio output.
